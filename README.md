This ALC toolbox is currently under construction. It will compile several independent tools for 
- monitoring performance
- visualization
- data analysis
  
of automatic low power lidars and ceilometers (ALC). The toolbox shall provide a single access point to all relevant tools for the ALC community.

The toolbox will include internal sub-repositories and links to external repositories.<img width="1369" height="971" alt="toolbox2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/790da1ac-21d5-4799-ae28-67b3a1fe21f8" />
